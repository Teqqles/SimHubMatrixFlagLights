You’ll also need solder, a soldering iron, some wire to hook it all up and a hot glue gun or some other way to attach the components to your case.  It’s also a good idea to have a multi-meter for testing but if you don’t have one it isn’t the end of the world, it’ll just make debugging a little harder if you have issues.
